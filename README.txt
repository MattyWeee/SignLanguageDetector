Setup: 
    Tensorflow 2.12.1, Python 3.11.7

How to use:
    Run SignLanguageDetector.py from the same directory as Model

Note: 
    The model that I have trained is highly inaccurate since I only used roughly 30 images per class. 
    If you have the time and resources to train a better model, you can collect data using dataCollection.py
    by creating a folder(s) to store data, setting the appropriate folder variable on line 13, and pressing 
    s to collect data using your webcam.

    Also, I trained the model using my left hand, so if you wish to use a different hand, you will have to train your own model.
