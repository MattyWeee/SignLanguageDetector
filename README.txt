Setup: 
    Tensorflow 2.12.1, Python 3.11.7

How to use:
    Run SignLanguageDetector.py from same directory as Model

Note: 
    The model that I have trained is highly innacurate since I only used roughly 30 images per class. 
    If you have the time and resources to train a better model, you can collect data using dataCollection.py
    by setting the appropriate folder variable and pressing s to take pictures using your webcam.
